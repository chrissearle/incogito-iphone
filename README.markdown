## Project Status

This project is mothballed. It was based on screen-scraping the JavaZone
website since there was no better back-end to talk to. From 2013 this is no
longer the case.

For the <a href="https://github.com/javaBin/ems-redux">EMS-Redux</a> based
application - please see <a href="https://github.com/chrissearle/ems-ios/">ems-ios</a>.

## iOS support

JavaZone 2011 supports iOS 4.0 and above.
